# Challenge Understanding
Briefly explain the problem statement of the DAY-3 challenge in your own words.
	We need to design a system for calculating the grades of university based on the internal marks they get. Mainly we need to store student marks from the user and store them in a list , then calculate the individual grades , number of valid and number of failed students based on the given conditions.Also we need to apply some personalization so that some lucky students get an advantage. We can use our own name , registration number or section for personalization to make our output unique than others. 
# Test Case Verification
Verify your program using the instructor-provided test cases.
Input marks=[95,82,67,45,30]
Test Case 1 Output:
Mark: 95 -> Excellent
Mark: 82 -> Very Good
Mark: 67 -> Good
Mark: 48 -> Average
Mark: 30 -> Fail
Total Valid Students: 5
Total Failed Students: 1

Input marks=[110,-5,70,39]
Test Case 2 Output: 
Mark: 110 -> Invalid
Mark: -5 -> Invalid
Mark: 70 -> Good
Mark: 39 -> Fail
Total Valid Students: 2
Total Failed Students: 1

Input marks=[103,36,85,99,72,64]
Test Case 3 Output:
Mark: 103 -> Invalid
Mark: 40 -> Average
Mark: 85 -> Very Good
Mark: 99 -> Excellent
Mark: 75 -> Very Good
Mark: 64 -> Good
Total Valid Students: 5
Total Failed Students: 0

# Learning Outcome
What did you learn from this challenge?
	From this challenge I learned the concept of applying a loop on a list and enhanced my skills on applying conditionals and personalization techniques based on my name length.
